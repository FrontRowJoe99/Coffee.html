  They say "Legends Never Die", although it's not always the case. Rarely do we hear of legends unbeknownst to us, one rooted in great discovery and wonder.

  
  According to legend, its origins begins in the 9th century. It is believed a goat herder named Kaldi accompanied by his goats came upon the greatest discovery of the century;coffee.

  
  Tracking along the Ethiopian Highlands located Northeast of Africa, Kaldi noticed his goats acting peculiar. Upon closer inspection he came across a tree with cherries hanging from its side.

  
  Before long, he realized what his goats had ate came with energizing effects never before seen. They were so energized they didn't sleep that night.

  
  Kaldi went on to report his findings to the abbot of the local monastery who struggled to stay awake during the long hours of evening prayer. In a stroke of genius, the abbot made a drink with the cherries given by Kaldi in which became coffee. 
  
  
  He too discoverd its energizing effects that helped him survive the evening nights of prayer. To his amazement, he shared his experience with other monks at the monastery.

  
  In conclusion, armed with the newly found discovery coffee spread like wildfire to multiple continents including the Middle East, Europe, Southeast Asia, North, Central, and South America.
